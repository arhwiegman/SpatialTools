# Name: FlowDirection_Example.py
# Description: Creates a raster of flow direction from each cell to its
#    steepest downslope neighbor.
# Requirements: Spatial Analyst Extension

# Import system modules
import arcpy
from arcpy import env
from arcpy.sa import *

# Set environment settings
env.workspace = "C:/sapyexamples/data"

# Set local variables
inSurfaceRaster = "elevation"
outDropRaster = "C:/sapyexamples/output/dropraster"

# Execute FlowDirection
outFlowDirection = FlowDirection(inSurfaceRaster, "FORCE", outDropRaster)

# Save the output 
outFlowDirection.save("C:/sapyexamples/output/outflowdir02")
